# Types of questions

> Mistaking the type of question being considered is the most common error
in data analysis (Leek & Peng, 2015)

<br>

Any specific data analysis can be broadly classified into one of six
types:

1. Descriptive
2. Exploratory
3. Inferential
4. Predictive
5. Causal
6. Mechanistic

.pull-left[
- Data analysis **is not** a linear, one-step-after-the-other process

- Data analysis **is** a highly iterative and non-linear process

- Information is learned at each step
  - Informs whether (and how) to refine, the step that was just
performed
  - Informs whether (and how) to proceed to the next step

There are 5 core activities of data analysis:

1. Stating and refining the question
2. Exploring the data
3. Building formal statistical models
4. Interpreting the results
5. Communicating the results

# Epicycle workflow (Peng & Matsui, 2018)

.pull-left[

For each of the 5 core activities, the following steps are critical

1. Set expectations
2. Collect data, and compare with expectations
3. Revise expectations or fix the data

Iterating through this 3-step process is called the **epicycle of data
analysis**

<!-- As you go through every stage of an analysis, you will need to go -->
<!-- through the epicycle to continuously refine your question, your -->
<!-- exploratory data analysis, your formal models, your interpretation, and -->
<!-- your communication. -->

- An analyst's data analysis can be compared to a songwriter's
  composition

- The methods were already taught to the computer

- We have the tools and the theory, but is up to each analyst to decide
  how to put things together

- That's the "spark of creativity", and that may not be easy to describe

# Reproducibility spectrum

- But, replicability is **hard**! (Sometimes even **impossible**!)

- So, we have two options

  1. Do nothing
  2. Reproduce the study

- The general idea is to create a **minimum standard** for judging
scientific claims ([Peng, 2011,
*Science*](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226.full))

# Reproducibility in science

<br>

If we already know the result, then why?

- Pattern for judging scientific claims

- Validate a data analysis

- Different views of the methods (thar art part)

- Avoid duplicated effort

- Improves team work

# Elements of reproducibility

.pull-left-60[
1\. **Data**
  - Must be provided the exact same way it was used in the analysis
  - If raw data was processed, both the raw data and the script that
  processed it must be provided

2\. **Code**
  - This automatically excludes point-and-click software
  - It must be executable all at once
  - If there are sets of files, then you need something to assure that
    they will be executed in the correct order
  - Make sure that all needed packages/software are installed (possibly
    in specific versions)
]
.pull-right-40[
3\. **Documentation**
  - Describe to humans what the code is doing (don't make people guess)
  - Describe the results

4\. **Distribution**
  - This could be to you, to your team, to your boss, or to the World
  - Share in a way that anyone can download and reproduce it

# Tools for reproducibility

## Publicar dados e códigos não é necessariamente uma tarefa trivial

.pull-left[
### Problemas comuns

- Muitos autores simplesmente "colocam" arquivos na *web*.
- Existem jornais que disponibilizam materiais suplementares, mas que
  sabidamente são desorganizados ou falhos.
- Mesmo quando dados e códigos estão disponíveis, o leitor ainda tem que
  baixar dados e códigos, e então tentar juntar tudo, uma tarefa que
  geralmente não é fácil e desencoraja a maioria das pessoas.
- O leitor pode não ter os mesmos recursos computacionais que o
  autor.

.pull-right[
Algumas dicas para ajudar a tornar um projeto reproduzível:

1. Documente tudo!
2. Tudo é um arquivo (de texto)
3. Todos os arquivos devem poder ser lidos por humanos
4. Organize e "amarre" seus arquivos de forma apropriada
5. Tenha um plano para organizar, armazenar, e tornar seus arquivos
   disponíveis

# Document your analyses: use dynamic documents

.pull-left-60[
- This concept dates back to 1984, when Donald Knuth (again) defined
  (and actually invented) what **literate programming** is
- It is a combination of a **markup language** (LaTeX, Markdown, HTML,
  etc) and one (or several) **programming languages**
  - Yes, you can mix R, Python, Bash, C, etc in the same document!
- When the document is compiled, the code is executed and you get an
  output (PDF, HTML, etc) with tables, figures, ...

# Document your analyses: use dynamic documents

.pull-left-40[
- **Sweave**
  - It's in R since the beginning of times
  - Allows only LaTeX as markup language
  - Only R as programming language
- **knitr**
  - Allows other markup languages (Markdown, HTML)
  - Allows many (14+) programming languages

]
.pull-right-60[
- **rmarkdown**
  - The "workhorse" is still knitr
  - Powered by [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a universal document
    converter
  - It is Pandoc that actually produces the final outputs in different
    formats
  <!-- - There are many variations of rmarkdown: bookdown, blogdown, -->
  <!--   thesisdown, etc -->
- **Quarto**
  - Is a stand-alone software for scientific publishing
  - Built on Pandoc, with many ideas borrowed from rmarkdown
  - Makes dynamic documents widely available, as it does not rely only
    in R and R packages

# Automate: two types of automation

.pull-left[
### Code level
- Create scripts for pre-processing data
- Create functions to execute repetitive tasks
  - Bash (Shell Linux/Unix) is your friend here
- Create a routine to run scripts in a specific order
  - Create a [MAKEFILE](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/what-how-makefile)
]

.pull-right[
### Deploy level
- Use Continuous Integration (CI) or Continuous Delivery (CD) platforms
to automate, test and deploy your project
- Your routines will run in an external, pristine environment to avoid
the famous
   - "*but it works on my computer*..."
- Some examples:
  - Github Actions
  - Gitlab CI
  - Travis CI
]

# Replicate your environment

.pull-left[
**Virtual environments**

- Makes a project self-contained (or almost) in terms of packages
- Easy to use and record all packages used and **in their specific versions**
- Recorded packages are downloaded and installed in the first use
  - In R: `renv`
  - In Python: `venv`
]

.pull-right[
**Container virtualisation**

- Virtualisation of an environment at the **operating system** level
- Containers are isolated from each other and can have their own
  software in any specific version
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the main tool
]

**In the reproducibility spectrum:**

# Archive your data

Use **data repositories** to share data (and get the proper credits)

- [figshare](https://figshare.com/)
  - Allows you to publish figures, tables, videos, data, etc.
  - Everything gets a **DOI** (Digital Object Identifier), so it can be
  cited
- [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)
  - Publish text and data
  - Also has DOI and link researchers with [Orcid](https://orcid.org/).
- [Nature recommended data
  repositories](https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories)
  - Compilation of several repositories
- [re3data](https://www.re3data.org/)
  - *REgistry of REsearch Data REpositories* is a tool to search for
    open access databases
