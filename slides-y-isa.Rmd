- **Adopt a workflow**
  - There are lots of them
  - Stick with one and go for it
  - There's no "best" workflow

- **Use appropriate methods**
  - *Data science as art*

- **Use the appropriate tools**
  - Automate everything
  - Version control your files

# Types of questions

> Mistaking the type of question being considered is the most common error
in data analysis (Leek, Peng)

<br>

Any specific data analysis can be broadly classified into one of six
types:

1. Descriptive
2. Exploratory
3. Inferential
4. Predictive
5. Causal
6. Mechanistic

- Data analysis **is not** a linear, one-step-after-the-other process

- Data analysis **is** a highly iterative and non-linear process

- Information is learned at each step
  - Informs whether (and how) to refine, the step that was just
performed
  - Informs whether (and how) to proceed to the next step

There are 5 core activities of data analysis:

1. Stating and refining the question
2. Exploring the data
3. Building formal statistical models
4. Interpreting the results
5. Communicating the results

- *Sharing the results*

# Epicycle workflow (Peng, Matsui)

.pull-left[

For each of the 5 core activities, the following steps are critical

1. Set expectations
2. Collect data, and compare with expectations
3. Revise expectations or fix the data

Iterating through this 3-step process is called the **epicycle of data
analysis**

<!-- As you go through every stage of an analysis, you will need to go -->
<!-- through the epicycle to continuously refine your question, your -->
<!-- exploratory data analysis, your formal models, your interpretation, and -->
<!-- your communication. -->

O processo de análise de dados por um pesquisador pode ser comparado ao
processo de **criação de uma música por um músico**.

Os métodos já foram ensinados ao computador, cabe ao analista **saber
como juntar as ferramentas** e aplicá-las para responder questões
relevantes para a ciência e para as pessoas.

# Tools for a colaborative workflow

- The key tools are the ones that makes all the steps **reproducible**
  by **anyone** in your team

1. Make it reproducible for you first!
2. Make it reproducible to your team
3. Make it reproducible to anyone else
